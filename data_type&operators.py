# What are data types and operators
# bool, numbers and strings
# operators: arithmatic

# - + / * %
# - used to subtract 2 val
# used to add 2 val
# * multiply
# / divide
# % gives the remainder

# comparison operators
# >
# <
# ==
# !=
# <=
# >=

# number_1 = 4
# number_2 = 2

print(number_1+number_2) # add two vals
print(number_1-number_2) # subtract two vals
print(number_1*number_2) #multiply
print(number_1/number_2) #divide
print(number_1%number_2) #remainder
print(number_1**number_2)
number_1 = 4
number_2 = 2

# lets look at bool vals
print(number_1 == number_2) # is number1 == to number 2 (True/False)
print(number_1!=number_2) # is num1 not equal to num2
print(number_1>=number_2)
print(number_1<=number_2)
