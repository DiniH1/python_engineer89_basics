#  Python
python is a dynamically typed language
# lets test
print("Hello Dini H")
#print func used to display outcome provided in the string

#Variables
#python variables as a place holder to store data
# it could me a string "anything between these quotations"
# integers/numbers
#Syntax to create a variable name of the variable = value of the variable
#foolow your logical naming convention

First_Name = 'Dini'
Last_Name = 'Hassan'
#lets create val to store int val
Salary = 10.5 #float val contains decimal
age = 19 #int value
my_age = '22'


#print(First_Name)
#print(Last_Name)
#print(Salary)
#print(age)
#print(my_age)
#type(age) helps us find the type of variable
#print(type(age))
#print(type(my_age))#will

#input() is python to interact with user to ask user required data
user_name = input("Please enter your name ")
print('Hello ')

print(user_name)

# Ativity
# variables first_name, last_name, age, DOB
#prompt user is input above below
#print/display the type of each val recieved from user
#then display the data back to the user with greeting message

# What are data types and operators
# bool, numbers and strings
# operators: arithmatic

# - + / * %
# - used to subtract 2 val
# used to add 2 val
# * multiply
# / divide
# % gives the remainder

# comparison operators
# >
# <
# ==
# !=
# <=
# >=

# number_1 = 4
# number_2 = 2

print(number_1+number_2) # add two vals
print(number_1-number_2) # subtract two vals
print(number_1*number_2) #multiply
print(number_1/number_2) #divide
print(number_1%number_2) #remainder
print(number_1**number_2)
number_1 = 4
number_2 = 2

# lets look at bool vals
print(number_1 == number_2) # is number1 == to number 2 (True/False)
print(number_1!=number_2) # is num1 not equal to num2
print(number_1>=number_2)
print(number_1<=number_2)
